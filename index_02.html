<!--Bug fixed-->
<!--
1. Missing <!DOCTYPE html> declaration (should be at the very top).

2. <body> is incorrectly placed inside the <title> tag.

3. <head> is not closed properly before <body>.

4. <div> elements are placed outside of <body>, and not properly nested.

5.The tags are mismatched and unordered, which breaks the document structure-->
